Spring Boot application designed to manage categories and products efficiently.
This project demonstrates a RESTful API that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on categories and products.
It also showcases the implementation of a one-to-many relationship between categories and products using JPA and Hibernate.

Features:

CRUD Operations: Easily create, read, update, and delete categories and products.
One-to-Many Relationship: A single category can have multiple products, demonstrating a one-to-many relationship using JPA annotations.
RESTful API Design: Clean and well-structured API endpoints for seamless interaction.
Pagination: Server-side pagination to efficiently handle large datasets.
Spring Boot Integration: Utilizes Spring Boot for rapid development and deployment.
JPA and Hibernate: Leverages JPA and Hibernate for database operations and ORM mapping.
MySQL Database: Configured to work with a relational database instead of an in-memory database.
